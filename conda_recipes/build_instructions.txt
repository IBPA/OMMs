# This file includes instructions for building and uploading conda recipes
# related to this project (r-maxpro and r-omms). Note r-maxpro is a necessary
# dependency that we use (hence created a conda recipe).

# Install anaconda-clint
conda install anaconda-client

# Prioritize conda-forge to avoid package conflicts
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict

# Build skeleton for r-maxpro (this is already done, won't need to be repeated)
# conda skeleton cran MaxPro

# Build r-maxpro and upload
conda-build r-maxpro
anaconda login
anaconda upload  miniconda3/conda-bld/osx-64/r-maxpro-4.1_2-r35hb9e6c45_0.tar.bz2

# Build r-omms and upload (change version and location as needed)
conda-build r-omms
anaconda upload miniconda3/conda-bld/osx-64/r-omms-0.1.4-0.tar.bz2
